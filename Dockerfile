# Build Stage
#
# This stage installs all dependencies (including dev), builds the TypeScript
# source code into JavaScript, and prepares the production assets.
#
# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM rather than the target platform: `bun run build` emits
# JavaScript, and only `dist/` crosses into the production stage, which runs its
# own target-arch install. Built for the target instead, the non-native leg of a
# `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` build runs under QEMU, where bun >= 1.4
# aborts with a JavaScriptCore allocator assertion and fails the multi-arch push.
#
# The constraint this assumes: the build stage produces platform-independent
# output. A stage that compiles a native addon needs the target-arch toolchain
# and cannot cross-compile this way — drop the flag there.

# This stage runs on the target platform, so the install resolves the DuckDB
# native binding for that architecture: the bindings are os/cpu-gated
